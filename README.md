# AST_IRES_2020_APP

For the Java project, I have the ASTProducer.java file which takes in the given directory and will make a list of all .java files to make AST's out of. These made AST's from the java parser will be stored in a new file with the same found name with a .ast extension in the same place it was found. In the ASTProducer.java file there is additional code to be able to reverse print the code found from the generated file and code to print the ast generated to a a new file with the same found name with a .txt extension. These two additions are optional so therefore I have commented out these two marking where they are commented out. The ASTProducer.java file will have an associated pom file and I will post the full project in a separate spot within this repository.
